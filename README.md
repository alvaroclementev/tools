# Tools

Set of tools for personal use


## Installing tools

For basic tools (single executable file) you can use the `install` script at 
the top level, which will create a symlink to the file in the `bin/` directory
in this repo. For instance

```sh
./install howto
```

You can then add this `bin/` directory to your `$PATH` and every tool will be available.
